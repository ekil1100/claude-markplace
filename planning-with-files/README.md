# planning-with-files

Manus-style persistent markdown files for planning and progress tracking.

## Skills

- **planning-with-files** - Use persistent markdown files as "working memory on disk" for complex tasks

## Usage

This plugin automatically activates when you:
- Start multi-step tasks (3+ steps)
- Begin research projects
- Request planning or organization
- Need to track progress across multiple tool calls

## The 3-File Pattern

For complex tasks, the skill creates:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `task_plan.md` | Track phases and progress |
| `notes.md` | Store research and findings |
| `[deliverable].md` | Final output |
